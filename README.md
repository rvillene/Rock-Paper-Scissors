Project Name: Game - Rock, Paper, Scissors
Author: Reid Villeneuve

Project Start Date: July 20th, 2021

Languages Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Brief Description of Project:

This is my very first game I built using the skills that I have learned since I started my Web Development Career journey back in April 2021. My approach to the design was very minimalistic, but fully functional. I believe I have met the bar on this.

Biggest Achievement on this project:

- Overcoming my fear of building a project on my own.

Biggest Challenge on this project:

- CSS styling and alignment was my biggest challenge. Tweak, tweak again..oh and tweak once more.

Take aways from this project:

1. Slow down, its not a race. Quality over quantity.
2. Continue to build on my CSS skills as there is room for improvement.
3. Don't be so damned hard on myself. It's my first project!

Resources Used:

1. Hand-written notes taken from Jonas Schmedtmann's JS and HTML/CSS courses.
2. Head-First HTML/CSS book.
3. MDN Mozilla Website.
4. Caffeine.
5. Brain (Yes, Brain as in human brain)
6. David Bernier - whenever i needed extra motivation and a slight push, he was there. (My Collegue from my current job - he is also on a Web Dev Journey --> Tech Twitter - @DavidBernier).
7. Alex - Color Coordinator Extraordinaire(sp?); provided constructive criticism/feedback on my color schemes (Tech Twitter - @alexan_dev).
8. Google(You will always be my Hero!).
